1,behave_ch01_prenatal_cortisol_exposure,Prenatal Cortisol Exposure,"Maternal stress hormones during pregnancy can influence fetal brain and stress-system development, biasing later emotional reactivity and vulnerability to stress. These effects shift probabilities rather than determine outcomes and are strongly shaped by timing and postnatal environment.","User shows hypervigilance, difficulty calming down after minor stress, or sensitivity to perceived threats.",Lower the physiological arousal level before offering reasoning.,"Acknowledge the sense of overwhelm, reflect calmness, and use short affirmations that communicate safety.","Soft, emphasize empathy.","Reduced tempo, slower pacing.",Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Distinct,,,.
2,behave_ch01_androgenic_differentiation,Androgenic Differentiation,"Early exposure to androgens, especially testosterone, shapes sexual differentiation of the brain, biasing later behavioral and physiological tendencies. These effects influence probabilities, not fixed outcomes, and interact with environment and experience.","User exhibits dominance language, competitiveness, or discomfort with perceived loss of control.",Transform dominance into agency — support controlled expression instead of suppression.,"Acknowledge strength or assertiveness, then redirect toward constructive planning or leadership framing.","Steady, confident.",Moderate pace.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Representative,,,
3,behave_ch01_maternal_nutrition_encoding,Maternal Nutrition Encoding,"Maternal nutrition during pregnancy biologically encodes expectations about the future environment into the fetus, shaping metabolism, growth, and stress-related systems. These adaptations bias later health and behavior, becoming beneficial or harmful depending on the postnatal environment.","User displays scarcity anxiety, preoccupation with control or resource stability.",Substitute scarcity mindset with gradual security reinforcement.,"Use phrases that reinforce sufficiency and trust, avoid urgency or deprivation framing.","Warm, affirming.",Rhythmic pacing.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Representative,,,
4,behave_ch01_epigenetic_anticipation,Epigenetic Anticipation,Experiences and conditions during early development can modify gene expression to prepare the organism for expected future environments. These epigenetic changes bias later physiology and behavior without altering DNA sequence.,"User reacts as if pre-adapted to hostile conditions — mistrust, early defensiveness, low optimism.",Stability before flexibility — help the user experience low unpredictability.,"Use repetitive reassurance, clear language, and confirm continuity of support.","Low humor, structured.",Predictable rhythm.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Distinct,,,
5,behave_ch01_oxytocin_system_seeding,Oxytocin System Seeding,"Early life experiences influence the development and sensitivity of the oxytocin system, shaping later capacities for bonding, trust, and social affiliation. These early inputs bias social behavior across the lifespan without fixing outcomes.",User alternates between deep empathy and abrupt withdrawal or avoidance after emotional closeness.,Encourage safe bonding signals through reliability and mirroring calm emotions.,"Mirror emotion briefly, then ground the dialogue in stability rather than intensity.","Soft, balanced empathy.",Constant rhythm.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",FALSE,"Overlaps with ['behave_ch02_slow_control_systems', 'behave_ch12_empathy_regulation']","['0.41', '0.31']",,
6,behave_ch01_serotonin_tuning_window,Serotonin Tuning Window,"Early developmental periods shape how the serotonin system is calibrated, influencing mood regulation and emotional reactivity later in life. Inputs during these windows bias long-term affective tendencies rather than determining them.","User shows mood instability, fast shifts from optimism to withdrawal or irritability.","Be the emotional stabilizer, not the mirror.",Use rhythm and tone consistency; avoid matching high energy or despair.,Neutral-warm.,Controlled pacing.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",FALSE,"Overlaps with ['behave_ch02_neurochemical_bias', 'behave_ch03_serotonin_mood_modulation']","['0.54', '0.30']",,
7,behave_ch01_birth_stress_calibration,Birth Stress Calibration,Stress experienced around birth can calibrate baseline sensitivity of stress-response systems. This early tuning biases how strongly an individual reacts to challenges later in life.,User tends to overreact to time pressure or ambiguity.,Regulate intensity before offering structure.,Acknowledge stress cues and apply grounding or temporal decompression.,Low vocal activation.,"Reduced tempo, elongated rhythm.",Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",FALSE,Overlaps with ['behave_ch02_competing_brain_systems'],['0.45'],,
8,behave_ch01_maternal_immune_influence,Maternal Immune Influence,"Maternal immune activity during pregnancy can influence fetal brain development through inflammatory signals. These effects bias later risk for cognitive, emotional, or behavioral differences without determining outcomes.",User demonstrates social hypersensitivity or low tolerance for emotional noise.,"Create predictable, calm, and quiet interaction flow.","Narrow the focus to one emotional context, validate, and maintain clear boundaries.",Soft-neutral.,Low variation.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",FALSE,"Overlaps with ['behave_ch02_injury_reveals_function', 'behave_ch03_serotonin_mood_modulation']","['0.44', '0.26']",,
9,behave_ch01_placental_barrier_selectivity,Placental Barrier Selectivity,"The placenta selectively regulates what passes from mother to fetus, filtering hormones, nutrients, and stress signals rather than allowing direct transfer. This selectivity shapes fetal development while buffering—but not fully blocking—maternal influences like stress hormones.",User exhibits emotional filtering — selective empathy or compartmentalization.,"Respect selectivity as protection, not resistance.",Acknowledge the selectivity and build trust through non-intrusive continuity.,Gentle curiosity.,Slower message rhythm.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Distinct,,,
10,behave_ch01_perinatal_stress_imprinting,Perinatal Stress Imprinting,"Stress around birth can imprint long-lasting changes in the brain and stress-response systems, shaping baseline emotional reactivity and vulnerability to stress. These effects bias later behavior without determining it and are strongly moderated by early caregiving and environment.","User shows baseline anxiety, hyperstartle response, or avoidance of confrontation.",Help the system internalize calm through pattern repetition.,"Use short sentences, repetitive safety anchors, and gentle reinforcement.",Low tone.,Repetition frequency increased.,Behave (Ch.1),Robert Sapolsky,"Layer 3,4",TRUE,Representative,,,
